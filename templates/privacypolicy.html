                  <h4>Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses</h4>
                  <hr><br>
                  <p>An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're on the Internet. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When collecting information for us, our service provider does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable; however, this institution and our service providers may use IP addresses to audit the use of our site. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when necessary for security purposes.</p>

                  <h4>What is a Cookie?</h4>
                  <hr><br>
                  <p>A cookie is a very small text file sent by a web server and stored on your hard drive, your computer’s memory, or in your browser so that it can be read back later. Cookies are a basic way for a server to identify the computer you happen to be using at the time. Cookies are used for many things from personalizing start up pages to facilitating online purchases. Cookies help sites recognize return visitors and they perform a very important function in secure Internet banking.
                    <br><br>
                  Our service provider uses cookies simply to facilitate the customization and personalization of our website/app. For your security, our service provider does not store any personally identifiable information in cookies which are further described below.</p>

                    When registered users login to the website, our service provider may also send cookies called "per-session" cookies or "server-side" cookies.
