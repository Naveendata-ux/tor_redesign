<p>Tires On Rent is a classified ads website where owners can post ads about their extra or unwanted tires and tire seekers can rent or rent to own or buy the tires they need. Once the tire seeker finds his/her tires, they can contact the tire owner for next steps.
 All transactions will happen outside of this website.<br>

Is there a minimum or maximum period regarding the tenure of my tire rental?

</div>
<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">
<p>
This is something you and the tires owner can discuss with complete liberty and agree upon what 
tenure works best for both you and the owner. Our website does not restrict on how long you can 
rent tires for.

How do I pay the owner if I have selected the tire I want?

<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">
<p>
All payments made for tires to rent, rent to own or buy are done directly to the tire owners by 
the tire seekers on the agreed payment method. You don't need to worry about the hassles of paying online.

How does Rent to Own option work?
</a>
</h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">
<p>
Generally speaking, renting tires is an option for a shorter duration like for a season or for 6 months. 
However, under Rent to Own option, tire seeker keeps the tires forever but the tenure could be longer than a season.
 For example, if you rent the tires to own, you can rent them for an year and after one year you donâ€™t have to pay anymore and keep the tires. Price could be little more than what you pay for just renting. Its all between the owner and tire seeker to negotiate the price and tenure

What happens if my newly rented/bought tire goes flat?
</a>
</h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSix" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">
<p>
In such a case, you will need to contact the vehicle owner to discuss if they had any insurance. 
Or you can have them fixed if you had owned the tires. The Tires On Rent company will not be held 
liable if anything happens to the tires you have purchased.

What if I want a refund?
</a>
</h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">
<p>
Refunds are possible but only in cases where the reasons are valid. This is because the deal was sealed with an agreement and it is not possible to just back off from the agreement anytime. However, in the case of a legit reason, you are allowed to take back your refund e.g. you paid for a month, used the tires for 3 days, you may be refunded by the tire owner for the remaining days of the month that you paid for. Returns and refunds are at the owners discretion.

Your situation is understandable and such unfortunate events can occur. When such situation arises, you may need to contact the tire owner to redefine terms of your agreement.

That's definitely possible. There's no minimum or maximum rental tenure on our platform. Such terms can be discussed with your chosen tires' owner and we will finalize it with a rental agreement so the rights of both the parties are secure.
